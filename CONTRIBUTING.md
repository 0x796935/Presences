    <h1>Presence Guidelines</h1>
</div>

When publishing presences to this github, we require you to follow a set of guidelines.
To some, these strict rules may seem harsh. However, the implementation of these rulesets will keep our servers from running into any issues.

> • The pull request must be complete, you need to have a proper file structure. Including the `dist` folder, `presence.js` file, and `metadata.json` file.

> • Your pull request must receive 2 positive reviews.

> • The presence **must** be related to the website you have chosen.

> • The presence must not be of any illegal websites. These include stressors, drugs, child porn, etc...

> • The presence metadata must have well written content, including valid titles, and descriptions.

> • The media you include (icon/thumbnail) must be related to the website and should be understandable in terms of size and quality.

> • The file structure must be clean and managed, do not have random files which provide nothing to the presence's function.

> • The presence **must not** have any malicious intentions. These include stealing/leaking private information, negatively affecting the behavior of the website, etc...


*If you do not follow all of the guidelines, your presence will not get accepted and will be promptly closed or deleted.*
